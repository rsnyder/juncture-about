This formation is named because its shape resembles a mitten, with an extended "thumb" on one side.Similar in shape to West Mitten Butte, this formation is its counterpart, creating a mirrored mitten-like appearance.Merrick ButteThis butte is broader and less "mitten-like" compared to the other two. It is named after gold prospector Thomas Merrick, who explored the area.[![](https://v3.juncture-digital.org/badge.png)](https://v3.juncture-digital.org)

**Monument Valley**, meaning "valley of the rocks", is a region of the Colorado Plateau characterized by a cluster of sandstone buttes, with the largest reaching 1,000 ft (300 m) above the valley floor.[^1] The most famous butte formations are located in northeastern Arizona along the Utah–Arizona state line. The valley is considered sacred by the [Navajo Nation](Q1783171), the Native American people within whose reservation it lies.[^2]

Major rock formations include [West and East Mitten Buttes](zoomto/675,518,2909,1937), [Merrick Butte](zoomto/3759,1040,1455,969/f8d317c8), Hunts Mesa, Eagle Mesa, Sentinel Mesa, Brighams Tomb, Castle Rock, Stagecoach, Big Indian, Rain God Mesa, Spearhead Mesa, Mitchell Mesa, Mitchell Butte, Gray Whiskers, Elephant Butte, Camel Butte, Cly Butte, King-on-his-Throne, Rooster Rock, and Setting Hen. Another notable formation is [Totem Pole](Q7828304), a highly eroded butte remanent. The valley also includes large stone structures, such as the "Eye of the Sun".

## Geography and geology

`map Q192017,4 "Monument Valley" marker right`

[Monument Valley](flyto/Q192017,11) is part of the Colorado Plateau. The elevation of the valley floor ranges from 5,000 to 6,000 feet (1,500 to 1,800 m) above sea level. The floor is largely siltstone of the Cutler Group, or sand derived from it, deposited by the meandering rivers that carved the valley. The valley's vivid red coloration comes from iron oxide exposed in the weathered siltstone. The darker, blue-gray rocks in the valley get their color from manganese oxide.

The buttes arising from the valley floor are clearly stratified, with three principal layers. The lowest layer is the Organ Rock Shale, the middle is de Chelly Sandstone, and the top layer is the Moenkopi Formation capped by Shinarump Conglomerate. 

Between 1945 and 1967, the southern extent of the Monument Upwarp was mined for uranium, which occurs in scattered areas of the Shinarump Conglomerate; vanadium and copper are associated with uranium in some deposits.

## Tourism and media

Monument Valley includes much of the area surrounding Monument Valley Navajo Tribal Park, a Navajo Nation equivalent to a national park. Oljato, for example, is also within the area designated as Monument Valley.  Visitors may drive through the park on a 17-mile (27 km) dirt road. Parts of Monument Valley, such as Mystery Valley and Hunts Mesa, are accessible only by guided tour.

Monument Valley has been featured in many forms of media since the 1930s. Famed director John Ford used the location for a number of his Westerns. Film critic Keith Phipps wrote that "its five square miles [13 km2] have defined what decades of moviegoers think of when they imagine the American West".[^3]
