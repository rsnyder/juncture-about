# About Juncture

Juncture is a set of services and web components designed to work with GitHub and Markdown to easily create interactive web pages/sites.  

GitHub is a free web service that provides file and web hosting, Markdown file editing, and powerful tools for collaboration and workflow management.  Markdown is a simple markup language commonly used for formatting plain text.

Juncture components can be easily added to any Markdown text to create interactive and engaging web pages.

## Juncture History

### Initial version

The [Plant Humanities Lab](https://lab.plant-humanities.org) is a web site hosting visual essays that "Explore the cultural histories of plants and their influence on human societies".  The Plant Humanities Lab was launched in 2021 as a key output of 2 Mellon funded projects jointly conducted by Dumbarton Oaks and JSTOR Labs.

The infrastructure for the Plant Humanities Lab enables non-programmers to generate a single visual essay or a rich web site consisting of multiple interactive visual essays.

A generalized version of the visual essay rendering code developed for the Plant Humanities Lab was released at the conclusion of the development projects as [Juncture](https://v3.juncture-digital.org)

#### Recent versions

Following the release of Juncture in Fall 2021, Juncture continued to evolve and addressed some of the lessons learned in developing and using the first version.

- Improved flexibility in page layouts, including better rendering on mobile devices
- Enhanced IIIF support, including new capabilities for creating and using self-hosted image collections in Github
- Authoring tools for easier editing
    - Preview from editor
    - Drag-and-drop for images and videos with automatic tag creation
- Improved on-line documentation with drag-and-drop and cut-paste code snippets
- Viewer components reimplemented as standard HTML5 Web Components enabling use outside of Juncture environments, including in vanilla HTML pages and Wordpress

The Juncture web site is located at https://juncture-digital.org.  A beta site for the 3rd generation of Juncture is located at https://v3.juncture-digital.org.  This version will be released before the end of 2024 and is generally recommended for use.

## Key technologies used in Juncture

A guiding principle in the development of the Plant Humanities Lab (and the subsequent evolution of Juncture) was use of free and/or open-source tools where possible in a minimal computing environment. 

### Github

[GitHub](https://www.github.com), Inc. is a platform and cloud-based service commonly used for software development and version control.  It provides distributed version control plus access control, bug tracking, software feature requests, task management, continuous integration, and project wikis.  Github has been a subsidiary of Microsoft since 2018.

As of 2023, GitHub reported having over 100 million developers and more than 372 million repositories, including at least 28 million public repositories. It is the world's largest source code host as of June 2023.

Github features incclude,

- File storage (Markdown, images, annotations, etc)
- A rich API for programmatic interaction with repository contents
- Version control
- Support for implementation of publishing workflows
- Web hosting, with custom domains
- Most features are free to use (including all features used by Juncture)

New Github users may find the first couple episodes in the [Github for Poets](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZF9C0YMKuns9sLDzK6zoiV) video series helpful as a gentle introduction to Github use and concepts.

### Markdown

[Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor. Markdown was created in 2004 as a markup language that is easy to read in its source code form.  Markdown is widely used for blogging and instant messaging, and also used elsewhere in online forums, collaborative software, documentation pages, and readme files.

### Wikidata

[Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org) is a collaboratively edited multilingual knowledge graph hosted by the Wikimedia Foundation.It is a common source of open data that Wikimedia projects such as Wikipedia, and anyone else, can use under the CC0 public domain license. Wikidata is a wiki powered by the software MediaWiki, including its extension for semi-structured data, the Wikibase.

### International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF)

[The International Image Interoperability Framework](https://iiif.io) (IIIF, spoken as 'triple-I-eff') defines several application programming interfaces that provide a standardised method of describing and delivering images over the web, as well as "presentation based metadata" (that is, structural metadata) about structured sequences of images. If institutions holding artworks, books, newspapers, manuscripts, maps, scrolls, single sheet collections, and archival materials provide IIIF endpoints for their content, any IIIF-compliant viewer or application can consume and display both the images and their structural and presentation metadata.

### Leaflet

    - Q213439

[Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) is an open source JavaScript library used to build web mapping applications. First released in 2011, it supports most mobile and desktop platforms, supporting HTML5 and CSS3. Among its users are FourSquare, Pinterest and Flickr.

Leaflet allows developers without a GIS background to very easily display tiled web maps hosted on a public server, with optional tiled overlays. It can load feature data from GeoJSON files, style it and create interactive layers, such as markers with popups when clicked.

### GeoJSON

[GeoJSON](https://geojson.org/) is an open standard format designed for representing simple geographical features, along with their non-spatial attributes. It is based on the JSON format.

The features include points (addresses and locations), line strings (streets, highways and boundaries), polygons (countries, provinces, tracts of land), and multi-part collections of these types.
